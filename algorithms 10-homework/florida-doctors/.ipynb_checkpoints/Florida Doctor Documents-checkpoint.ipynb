    "# Florida Physician Violations: Dealing with ugly documents\n",
    "\n",
    "I did most of the grunt work for you - scraped a databases, downloaded a million PDFs, automatically ran them through `convert` and `tesseract` in the hopes of coming out with readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, **the text looks like trash**. Scans at weird angles, nothing looks right, text issues all over the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I'm looking for documents that deal with **opioids** - Vicodin, hydrocodone, oxycodone, etc. What are some techniques we can use to effectively search these documents? And most importantly, **is it different than what we did with the New York doctors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I'm looking for documents that deal with **sexual assault** or **sexual harassment**, which take a lot more forms than opioids, and may have indirect language used to describe them. Are our search techniques the same as above?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** When dealing with dirty text, you might want to use something like fuzzywuzzy [repo](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy), which we [covered in class](http://jonathansoma.com/lede/algorithms-2017/classes/fuzziness-matplotlib/fuzzing-matching-in-pandas-with-fuzzywuzzy/), or [jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish), which we didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Question:** Is machine learning really the best technique? Maybe, maybe not! There are a handful other other approaches I can think of off of the top of my head, and not all of them are that technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to clean the data up a *little* down below, then it's up to you. You can search for whatever you'd like. Yes, there aren't that many, but that's just because it's soooo slow to convert to JPG and run tesseract!"
