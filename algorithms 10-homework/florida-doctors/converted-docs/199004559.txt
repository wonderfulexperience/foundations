I hereby certify that during the period January 1,
1986, through December 31, 1987, I have obtained
no fewer than forty (40) hours of continuing medical
education courses which meets the requirement of
Chapter 455.213(5), Florida Statutes, and Rule
21M-28.002(6). I hereby certify that at least five

that I must maintain such receipts, vouchers,

CHE requirements for a period of not less than

I affirm that these statements are true and correct
and recognize that providing false information may
result in a fine, suspension or revocation of my
license as provided in Florida Statutes 455.2275,
775.082, or 775.084.

9. The aforementioned statement was required as part of
the renewal process for the licensing period from January 1, 1988,

through December 31, 1989. without this statement, Respondent

udpguw

could not have renewed his license to practice medicine in Florida.

10. Thereafter, Respondent successfully renewed his
license to pfactice medicine in Florida. That renewal was based,
in part, on the aforementioned statement regarding completion of
Continuing Medical Education.

11. Thereafter, Respondent was selected randomly for
audit purposes to verify his continuing medical education for the
period covered in his statement (January 1, 1986 through December
31, 1987). By letter dated November 30, 1988, Respondent was
requested to provide the verification of continuing education.
Respondent failed to comply with this request.

Respondent by Dorothy J. Faircloth, Executive Director for the
Board of Medicine, requesting documentation of continuing medical
education for the 1986 - 1987 period. That information was to be
provided within 7 days of receipt of the letter.

13. On or about May 31, 1989, Respondent responded to
Ms. Faircloth's May 2, 1989, letter after telephoning the Board of
Medicine office, in part, as follows:

This letter will confirm my conversation with you
regarding the requirements of Continuing Medical
Education of Florida Licensed Physicians.

You confirmed that your office had received

my notarized copy of my Physicians Recognition
Award valid until December 31, 1989.

You noted that I had not completed a Risk
Management Course. To fulfill this require-
ment, I have enrolled in the University of
Florida office for CME in their "Medical
Malpractice and Risk Management" dated 1989.

The tapes have been received from Education and
Reviews Inc. (account #519736 dated 5/9/89.

Uueuu:

The answer card will be remitted ASAP.

Thank you for your help in resolving my
1”accreditation problems.

Additionally, Respondent had forwarded to the Board of Medicine a
copy of his Physician's Recognition award issued by the American
Medical Association (AMA) and valid through December 1989.

14. Thereafter, on May 1, 1990, Respondent submitted a
statement from the University Of Florida Continuing Medical

management course for the 1988-1989 biennium.

, 15. None of the documentation of continuing medical-
education submitted by Respondent pertains to the 1986 - 1987
licensing period. On or about May 16, 1990, Respondent contacted

notification of the initiation of an investigation regarding the
CME deficiencies. At that time, Respondent stated that he was

advised that the continuing medical education courses completed in
1989 and 1990 would count toward the requirements for 1986 and
1987.
16. Respondent has failed to comply with the provisions
of Rule 21M-28.002, Florida Administrative Code for the 1986 - 1987
licensing period in two respects. First, Respondent has failed to
complete the five (5) hours of continuing education in the area of
risk management required as a condition of renewal for the 1986 -
1987 licensing period. Second, Respondent has failed to complete
the required forty (40) houre of continuing medical education for

the 1986 — 1987 licensing period.

17. Respondent made a fraudulent representation in order
to renew his license to practice medicine when he falsely certified
that he had égmpleted five (5) hours of risk management as part of
the forty (40) hours required for renewal of licensure, and he
falsely certified that he had completed forty (40) hours of
continuing education which complied with the requirements of Rule
21M28.002, Florida Administrative Code.
