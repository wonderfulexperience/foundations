regulating the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.30,

CQUNILQNE
3. On or about September 23, 1982, Respondent provided

surgical care and treatment for patient #1, in that Respondent

a
.n‘ ~' 3
'IVV'HO'U

performed a low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid for an

adenocarcinoma, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis of the
colon to the rectum and an incidental appendectomy upon
patient #1.

4. The standard of care requires that a surgeon
determine that the tumor has in fact been removed leaving
clear (disease free) margins prior to performing an end—to-end

anastomosis, in erder to eliminate the disease and prevent the

spread of the tumor beyond the involved organ. Such
determination may result from gross intraoperative inspection
or frozen section examination of the specimen.

5. The'patient's medical recerds contain a pathology
report of a frozen section which stated that the distal margin
of the specimen removed from patient #1 was not clear, but-
'rather contained moderately well differentiated adeno-
carcinoma which infiltrated the submucosa and muscularis. The
report stated that the proximal margin of the specimen was
clear of cancer cells.

6. The patient's medical records reveal that
Respondent's operative report contained ne documentation that
he determined, either grossly or microscopically, whether both
margins were clear of disease following the resection and

prior to performing an end-to-end anastomosis.

CQDNI_QNE

7. Petitioner alleges and incorporates paragraphs one

(1) through six (6) as if fully set forth herein.

OGJCQS

8. Respondent failed to practice medicine with that
level of care, skill and treatment which a reasonably prudent
similar physician recognizes as acceptable under similar
conditions and circumstances, in that Respondent failed to
determine whether the patient's tumor of the colon had been
completely removed leaving clear margins prior to performing
an end-to-end anastomosis of the organ.

9. Based on the preceding allegation. Respondent
violated Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida Statutes, in that
Respondent is guilty of gross or repeated malpractice or the
failure to practice medicine with that level of care, skill
and treatment which is recognized by a reasonably prudent

similar physician as being acceptable under similar conditions

and circumstances. «

CQUNI_IEQ

10. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one
(1) through six (6) and eight (8) as if fully set forth
herein. ‘

11. Respondent failed to keep written medical records
justifying the course of treatment of ﬁatient #1 including,
but not limited to, the following: Respondent failed to
document that he determined, either grossly or
microscopically, whether both margins were clear of diseased

,tissue prior to performing an end-to-end anastomosis; and

Respondent's medical records fail to justify joining a clear

proximal margin to a diseased distal margin.

12. Based on the preceding allegations, Respondent
violated Section 458.33111)(n), Florida Statutes (1983), now
Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida Statutes (1989), in that
Respondent failed to keep written medical records justifying
the course of treatment of patient #1 including, but not
limited to, patient histories} examination results and test

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests the Board

practice, impesition of an administrative fine, issuance of a
reprimand, plecement of the Respondent on probation, and/or

any other relief that the Board deems appropriate.
