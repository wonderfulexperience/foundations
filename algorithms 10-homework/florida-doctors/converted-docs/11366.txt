against me by the Department of Professional Regulation charging

proceedings based upon this complaint I hereby relinquish my
privileges to prescribe schedule I through III controlled substances

as defined by Chapter 893, Florida Statutes.

defined above shall be reinstated when I have successfully completed
40 contact hours of course work in pharmacology. I understand that
this course wofk is subject to approval by the Board of Medical

time spent in direct contact with my course instructor and shall not

probationary period of five (5) years. During said probationary period

I shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

A. Semi-annual appearances before the Board of Medical Examiners.

B. Periodic review of my patient records by a physician

designated by the Board of Medical Examiners to determine whether

I am appropriately prescribing controlled substances as defined

by Chapter 893, Florida Statutes.

C. Successful completion over a three (3) year period of
150 hours of catagory I AMA approved continuing medical education,
or an average of 50 annual hours of said continuing medical education.

6. It is clearly understood and agreed that in the event the

or the Board's Probable Cause Panel finds sufficient evidence to believe
probable cause exists that I have violated any of the conditions of
the probation as outlined above, my probationnﬁy be vacated and my
license to practice medicine in the State of Florida subject to
automatic immediate suspension, with further disciplinary proceedings
pursuant to Chapter 458, Florida Statutes, the Medical Practice Act.

accordance with Chapters 120 and 458, Florida Statutes, with regard
to the facts upon which such determination of probable cause was
predicated.

7. It is expressly understood that this Stipulation is subject
to approval by the Board of Medical Examiners and the Department
of Professional Regulation and has no force(mﬂ.effect until an Order
is entered based upon it by the Board of Medical Examiners.

avoiding further administrative action with respect to this cause and
to my license to practice medicine in the State of Florida. In this

regard, I expressly authorize the Board of Medical Examiners to

9. In the event that the Board of Medical Examiners fails to
approve this Stipulation and a hearing is held resulting in a finding
