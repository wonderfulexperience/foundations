Epinephrins injection and intravsnous bicarbonate. Patient

18. Betitioner’s expert witness opinsd that prior to
January 1987 Respondent's treatment of tho patisnt mat ths
prescribed standard of care for physicians, bit subssquent
thereto it did not. This opinion is prsdicatad upon the

worsening of Patient’s condition in January, Psbruary and March
1987. Although there was an abnormal EKG in 1984, no svidencs
was pressntsd that this EKG changed when subsequent EKGs wars
taken.

19. Respondent's notes stats no change in tho Exes
taksn through January 15, 1987. Tho sntry made January 15, 1987,
specifically found no change in EKG. Abnormal EKGs ware rsportsd
in 1984 and on January 7, 1987. No svidsnce was presented to
contradict the July 15, 1987, entry that thers was no change in
tho ERG. '

vssssls to and ﬁron the patient's hsart.

21. Dsspits the tact that Patient was at Hunana
Hospital which did not have a cardio-cath lab, istitionsr's
export opined that ths patisnt should have bash transferrsd to a
tertiary cars hosﬁital in the area with such facilities.

Respondent, on tho othsr hand, contsnds that invasive procedures

at that tins would have bash tatal to this patient.

‘haa.-.
8 vv5'v."

22. In his testimony Respondent opinad that tha
patient had chronic stable angina haters ha was even forty.
Further, that the patient tit in the category of the population
with a single coronary artery disease that have a malignant
course: that this patient, who had this type or artery disease,
was foradoomed to die, and nothing could have savad him, and that

any invasiva procedure would hava rasultad in tha daath o: the
patient. Respondent contends that the autopsy report confirms
this opinion.

23. Despite this tastinony a majority of the
publications prasantéd by Raspondant as lata-tilad exhibits

contained discussions ragarding the treatment of patiants with

.-

unstabla angina.
24. Petitioner's expert witnsss opined that the

rapidly dstsrioration of tha patiant on March 11, 1992, claarly
dancnstratad tha patient nasdad ta ha hospitalizad and invasive
' proceduras initiatad to datatuina ths condition or ths patiant's
'arterias. It is tha tailurs to initiate such procaduras that
rendered the treatment at this patiant balow tha minimum
acceptabla standards of traatnant racognizad by a raasonably

prudent similar physician as baing accaptabls under similar

circumstancas'and conditions.

25. Pltitionsr’s witnass turthar opined that tho
physician's records ragardinq this patient wars insutticiant to
justify tha course of traatnant of tha patiant. This opinicn was
based upon tha fact he found Rsspondant's records "rather

limited, ottan almost illegible, and did not really ratlact tho

. r'qJ'l‘ .V.

collection of subjective and objective data that could load one
then to follow the process of evaluation and managsnsnt of either

gastrointsstinal problems or cardiac problems." Hs further

concluded that those records did not rsflsct a cardiac diagnosis

of the patient.
CON LU IONS OF LAW

The Division or Administrativs Hearings has

these proceedings.

Under the provisions of Ssction 458.331(2), Florida
statutes, the Board of Medicins is smpowsrsd to tsvoks. suspsnd,
or otherwise discipline the license of a medical doctor of, igggg

alia, the following violations of Section 458.331(1), §;orida

 

statutes:

In thssa proceedings the Pstiticnsr has the burden of
proving the ailsgations by clear and convincing avidanca. Egggig
v. ngliggtcg, 510 So.2d 292 (Fla. 1987). I

Hers'Patitioner was trained in Cardiology and hold
himself cut as a Cardiologist, although not board certified. As

such, he is required to axarciss the cars and skill at a
cardiologist in trsating patients.

Respondent contends that, from tha autopsy rsport and
the history at this patisnt, nothing could have bean done on
March 12 and 13 to savs this patiant. No further sxpart opigion
to support this conclusion was prsssntad, including thoss
excerpts from medical journals subnittsd as lata-tilsd exhibits
by Respondsnt. Petitionsr’s sxpart witness opined that had stsps
bash tatsn March 12 or 13 to ascertain the condition at ths
pationt’s coronary blond vessels, stsps could haVa bash taksh ta
save this patisnt's 112a, aithar by angioplasty or open hsart
surgery.

Whila naithar opinion can ha sustainsd with curtainty,
it is clear that on hatch 12, 1937, the patisht was exhibiting
classical syaptons a: an impending cardiac accident and raquirsd
hospitaliiation and diagnostic tests to dstarnins the condition
at the blood vsssals lsading to and tron his heart. Although he
was hospitalizad, no invasivs procsdurss wars ordsrad to
ascsrtain the condition at thsss blood vsssals. Failure to
conduct thsss tastsj under tha circumstandes, constitutes gross
malpractice as dstinsd abova.

well documented, as are examination results, records or drugs

prescribed, and raports of consultations and hospitalizations.
For this charge. Patitionar has failed to sustain its burden.

1. Respondent is, and has been at all times material
‘ hereto, a licensed physician, having been issued license number HE
0017735, by the Statﬁtmorida (Petitioner's Exhibit #19). -_r

progressive chest pain (Transcript 20 - 22).

4. Mrs.!th described her husband's initial pain as
"squeezing" and later as "a mack truck on his chest". (Transcript
Page 22 - 23).“

5. During February, 1987 Mrs. .th and J.V. traveled
to Atlanta, Georgia to visit their son. The men were going to
exercise. They went to a park, and although he exercised heavily,

J.v. could not get his pulse to rise (Transcript Page 24). The

 

next day, J.V. attempted the same activity, but could not walk due
to severe chest pain. J.v. returneé home and went to see the
Respondent (Transcript Page 25). -n

6. Mrs. ”ch descriged the severe chest pain her

husband was experiencing fer three (3) weeks prior to his death.
He had to be helped to walk from his car to the office in the
mornings, and would call his wife upon arrival (Transcript Page
26).

7. On March 12, 1987, J.V. was unable to go to work due
t9 his chest pain. Attempts were made-to call Respondent's office,
but the answering service did not know the Doctor's whereaheuts.”
Finally, at approximately 10:00 p.n., Respondent called J.V., who
went to the hospital (Transcript Page 29 - 30). -

8. since there were no beds available, J.V. stayed in
the emergency room from 11:00 p.m. through the next morning. At
approximately 7:45 p.m. on March 13, 1987, J.V. suffered a heart
attack (Petitioner's Exhi ' 3, Page 1, Transcript Page 32);
Respondent related to Kramh her husband was "very bad", but
still thought the problem was gastro related including stomach
cancer (Transcript Page 32).

9. Mrs. Eh spoke to her husband briefly before his
death. After: Respdndent said that everything was tried, and "you
don't want an autopsy, do you?" (Transcript Page 33 - 34).

10. On July 23, 1976, presented at Respondent's office
with weight gain, tiredness, elevated blood pressure and puffy

eyes. The patient had a history of stomach upset, and an upper

"ov-

 

Gastrointestinal series three (3) years earlier revealed spastic
duodenum. (Petitioner's Exhibit 2, Page 1).

11. J.v. remained a patient of Respondent until his
death on March 13, 1987. J.v. saw Respondent approximately sixty
three (63) times during his life (Petitioner’s Exhibit #2).

12. J.V.'s original complaint was appropriately
diagnosed and treated as hypothyroidism (Petitioner's Exhibit #2,
Page 1, 8‘9).

13. In January 1982 the patient presented with shoulder

and neck pain and was advised to use a neck brace (Petitioner's

‘ Exhibit #2, Page 3, 14).

14. J.V. was an employee of General Electric, Largo,
Florida, and received yearly company physicals, which included x-
rays, EKG's, and other tests (Petitioner's Exhibit #1).

15. In July 1982, J.V. exhibited chest pain with
exercise (Petitioner's Exhibit #2, Page 4, 15).

16. In November 1982 the patient presented to the
Respondent with occasional chest pain, which Respondent described
as "well compensated". He was told to return in one (1) month
(Petitioner's Exhibit #2, Page 4). V

17. -Occasional chest pain was also noted during a June
28, 1984 office visit (Petitioner's Exhibit #2, Page 6, 19).

18. On December 4,1984, J.V. had an EKG performed by
General Electric, the results of which were interpreted as

"abnormal". (Petitioner's Exhibit #1, Page 337- 35). Dr. Azar was

722‘; “.vgmurw~,§(,ar.vg~,-;.3:§a.gv. . - ; n 2:; ‘3 . -._.. . .- run}! ; k; :wczvsh .. -- gas. , .; ,'V,~:._-r._-.r ;~,~&tk?t‘3'*,3}ti«"»‘.r-.»_ V g _ 1287‘» .» f -. . X .57.. “,1 .._7,.»%.;v_:_ _. 1:}- ...‘_,.

 

aware of this interpretation although no mention of such occurs in
his office notes (Petitioner's Exhibit #2 Page 72).

19. J.v. had another abnozéai EKG on January 3, 1986
which is also found in Dr. Azar's‘;ecords. (Petitioner's Exhibit
#2 Page 52).

2o. Thereafter, the patient requested a stress test,
which was scheduled by Dr. Azar on May 13, 1986 (Petitioner’s
Exhibit #2 Page 6, 53-55). The test was administered by Dr. Azar
at Humane Hospital, st. Petersburg on May 21, 1986 and was
terminated after 6.5 minutes. Although the tests results were not
acceptable, Dr. Azar's note states "no detectable symptomatic
ischemic heart disease" and recommends improved aerobic capacity.
No further diagnostic evaluation was ordered (Petitioner’s Exhipit
#2, Page 155).

21. On July 17, 1986, Dr. Azar discussed the "problem"
regarding exercise (Petitioner's Exhibit #2, Page 6).

22. On January 15, 1987, Dr. Azar's notes reflected an
EKG with no changes (Petitioner's Exhibit #2, Page 7). An EKG of;
January 7, 1987 from General Electric which was again interpreted
as "abnormal", was noted in Dr. Azar's records (Petitioner's
Exhibit #2, Page 26). No further diagnostic evaluation was
ordered. Dr- Azar indicates "patient to return in three (3).

months".

23. On February 23, 1987, J.v. returns with chest pain
upon walking short distances. Dr. Azar describes a normal EKG, and

prescribes Ativan for stress (Petitioner's Exhibit #2 Page 7). No

further diagnostic evaluation was ordered.

24. On March 2, 1987, J.V. ﬁresents with “lower eternal
discomfort" and an echocardiagram was oxiqered (Petitioner’s Exhibit
#2 Page 7, 26). Dr. Azar instructea patient to return in one (1)
month. I

25. On March 10, 1987, eight (8) days later, the patient

again retﬁrns with chest pain. No further diagnostic evaluation

was ordered. Dr. Azar prescribed Procardia (Petitioner's Exhibit
#2, Page 7).

26. On March 12, 1987, J.V. attempted to contact Dr.
Azar regarding his discomfort. Dr. Azar returned the patient's
telephone calls at approximately 10:00 p.n. and J.v. was taken to
the ‘hospital at approximately 11:00 p.n. complaining of pain
radiating tq the right. and left anterior" chest, several days
duration (Petitioner's Exhibit #3 Page 55). The diagnosis was "pre
infarction syndrome". At approximately 7:20 a.n. on March 13, 1987
an elevated CPK was noted. No invasive evaluation was considered
by Dr. Azar (Petitioner’s Exhibit #3 Page 35).

27. J.v. went into cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. on March
13, 1987, and expired. V

28. Dr. John C. Dormais who is Board certified in
Internal Medicine and Cardiology testified that as early as July
28, 1982, J.v. exhibited chest or epigastric pain which may have
been exertional and would have required some attempt to confirm or
refute a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, which is potentially

life threatening (Transcript page 81).

??T&"§’:‘-’. mi WF' »’

 

29. A stress test was performed at the insistence of the
patient and an electrocardiogram in reeponse to the exercise was,
in the opinion of the Department's expert, abnormal. No additional
tests were ordered (Record transcgipt page 86).

30. The record reflects that on January 15, 1987 there,
was an office note from the Respondent indicating "EKG with no

changes".' The record does not indicate any indication of another
test or plan (Record transcript page 88).

31. On February 23, 1987 the Respondent's office note
reflects a complaint of tightness in the chest walking short
distances frequently (Transcript record page 88). No additional

' tests were ordered at this time (Record transcript page 89).

32. On March 2, 1987 the patient was still complaining

.0: lower eternal discomfort. An echocardiagram was ordered and the

patient was told to return in one (1) month (Transcript page 89).
The Department’s expert was of the opinion that under the
circumstances an echocardiagram at reet was not a very useful test
(Transcript page 90).

33. The patient again presented on March 10, 1987,
complaining of chest pain an and off. Respondent ordered Procardia
and told the patient to return in one (1) week (Transcript page
91). No additional diagnostic testing was ordered at this time
(Transcript page 92). The Petitioner's expert opined that at this
juncture, given the patient's history, diagnostic testing should
have been ordered (Record transcript pages 92-93).

34. The patient presented on March 12, 1987 to Humane

 

Hospital, st. Petersburg, with severe chest pain (Record page 95).
At 12:41 a.m. on March 13, 1987 the patient had a blood chemistry
profile done which was abnormal in the_sense that his CPK enzyme
was elevated above normal limits‘iTranscript page 96; See also
Petitioner's Exhibit #3 Page 34). This elevation suggested the
heart had already been damaged (Transcript page 97).

'35. The patient had been observed overnight without
additional studies or invasive procedures being contemplated or
performed (Transcript page 98). The autopsy revealed a "100%
oeclusive anterior descending branch left, ccronary artery disease.

Healed apical infarction" (Transcript page 99, See else

' Petitioner's Exhibit #3, Page 1-8). The Department's expert was of

the opinion that there was a high probability that with additiqgal
diagnostic testing and intervention the patient couldihave survived
the infarction (Transcript page 100).

36. The Petitioner's expert, described the patient's
symptoms from 1986 through early 1987 as "fairly classic"
(Transcript page 101).

37; He stated that from the 1986 exercise
electrocardiogram, additional symptoms or the progression of
additional symptoms should have triggered diagnostic studies
because of the high probability of a severe underlying probleh
(Transcript page 101).

38. Dr. Dermois opined the Respondent failed to meet the
standard of care between January 1987 and the patient's

hospitalization in failing to confirm either ischemic heart disease

or coronary artery disease (Transcript Page 90).

,39' The Doctor further opined the standard at care was
breached in failing to take an agqggssive approach upon the
patient's elevated CPR, given his_history (Transcript Page 98).

40. Finally, the Department's expert stated the
Respondent's medical records failed to justify the course of

treatment provided the patient (Transcript Page 104).
