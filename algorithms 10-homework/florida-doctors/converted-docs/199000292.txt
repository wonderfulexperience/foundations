Patient #1, Respondent performed a bimanual palpation of the
uterus and determined the gestational age Of the fetus to be nine
(9) weeks. Respondent noted this finding on the medical reccrd
of Patient #1.

6. The medical records for Patient #1 indicate that at
approximately 2:08 p.m. on or about January 5, 1990, Respondent
began a dilitation and curzettage (D a C) of Patient #1.

7. At approximately 2:40 p.m. on or about January 5,
1990, Respondent halted the D & C being performed on Patient :1

after noting that the uterus of this patient was perforated, and

that omentum was protruding through the perforation. Th

l0, It is a generally accepted principle of medical

practice that a physician must use any means available to him to
correctly ascertain the duration of the pregnancy before

attempting an abortion procedure. A

I1; -The uterine perforation sustained by Patient #1 was an
avoidable.eomplication of the abortion procedure in that it

13. The Respondent failed to practice medicine with that
level of care, skill, and treatment which a reasonably similar
physician recognizes as acceptable under Similar conditions and
circumstances, in that the Respondent did not adequately assess
the gestational size of the fetus of Patient #1 prior to

unsure as to the results of the sonogram.
