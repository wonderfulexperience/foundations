ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Petitioner, Department of Professional
Regulation, hereinafter referred to as "Petitioner,“ and files this
Administrative Complaint before the Board of Medicine against John
C. Jowett, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," and
alleges:

1. Petitioner is the state agency charged with regulating
the practice of medicine pursuant to Section 20.30 Florida
Statutes, Chapters 455, Florida statutes and 458, Florida Statutes.

2. Respondent is and has been at all times material hereto
a licensed physician in the State of Florida, having been issued
license number ME 0006815. Respondent's last known address is 6017
Lexington Park, Orlando, Florida 32819.

3. On or about March 30, 1988, Patient #1 presented to Ashley
Breast Care Center for a routine mammogram.

4. This mammogram was read by Respondent.

5. Respondéht's report regarding the March 30, 1988 mammogram

described a normal baseline mammogram and recommended routine

follow-up for Patient #1.

6. There is no indication in the medical records that
Respondent communicated to the referring physician the existence
of a mass that would either need immediate biopsy or follow—up
filming.

7. Patient {1's mammogram demonstrates a well circumscribed
dense nodule with adjacent linear stranding in the upper half of
the left breast as seen only on the lateral projection.

8. On or about May 5, 1989, Patient #1 presented to Dr.
Whittaker complaining of a lump and pain in her left breast
whenever a lifting motion was attempted.

9. Patient #1 was given another mammogram at Northside Breast
Care by a physician other than Respondent.

10. Patient #1 was referred to a surgeon who in June, 1989
performed a partial mastectomy after determining that the mass in
the left breast was cancerous.

COUNT ONE

11. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one (1)
through ten (10) as if fully set forth herein this Count One.

12. Respondent failed to practice medicine with that level of
care, skill, and treatment which is recognized by a reasonably
prudent similar physician as being acceptable under similar
conditions and circumstances, in that Respondent failed to note
the dominate nodule on the March 30, 1988 mammogram; failed to
request a followfhp examination within a three to four month period

and failed to properly act as his patient’s advocate as evidenced

by Respondent's statement that the referring physicians would be
upset by a follow-up examination request.

13. Based on the preceding allegations, Respondent violated
Section 458.331(1)(t), Florida statutes, by gross or repeated
malpractice or the failure to practice medicine with that level of
care, skill, and treatment which is recognized as being acceptable
under similar conditions and circumstances.

COUNT TWO

14. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one (1)
through ten (10) and twelve (12) as if fully set forth herein this
Count Two.

15. Respondent failed to keep written medical records
justifying the course of treatment of Patient #1 in that Respondent
failed to document or make reference to the dominate nodule on the
March 30, 1988 mammogram and failed to document why a follow—up
examination was not requested within a three to four month period.

16. Based on the preceding allegations, Respondent violated
Section 458.331(1)(m), Florida statutes, by failing to keep written
medical records justifying the course of treatment of the patient,
including but not limited to, patient histories; examination
results; test results; records of drugs prescribed, dispensed, or
administered; and reports of consultations and hospitalizations.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the Board of
Medicine enter an Order imposing one or more of the following
penalties: reJBCation or suspension of the Respondent's license,

restriction of the Respondent's practice, imposition of an

administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of the

Respondent on probation, and/or any other relief that the Board

deem appropriate.
