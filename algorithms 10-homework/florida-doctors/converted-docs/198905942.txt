and blurred vision.

4. On or about May 18, 1989, Respondent becaaf)01?aﬁ that

patient #1 had anatomical narrow angles in both of her eyes and

ll. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs one
(1) through seven (7) and paragraph nine (9) as fully set forth

STATEHENT OP TEX ISSUES

. An Adjainistnativa_-,Conplaint—datod ¥ay+2rﬁs~rrmM
aménded at the commencement of the hearing 9n Jun: 14th, alleges

that Respondent violated Section 458.441(1)(t), P.s. by rendering
inappropriate treatment to a patient, by failing to ask

appropriate folbsw—up questions as to her pain and condition, and

by failing to see her in a timely manner.

‘ . - .

 

 

The issue is whether the Violations occurred, and it so

what discipline is appropriate.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The referenced Administrative Complaint originally
alleged two counts of violations of Chapter 458, F.S. relating to
the practice of medicine. At the hearing Petitioner voluntarily
dismissed count two with regard te allegations that Respondent
neglected to keep adequate written medical records regardﬁhg-the
treatment 0! a patient identified as-"Patient :1". Othe: non-
substantive amendments were made with regard to the allegations
'0; count one, without objection by Respondent:

Petitioner presented the testimony of Anna Hae Miller,
Michelle Spinelli and Curtis Benton, Jr., H.D.; and exhibits A-F,
received without objection.

Respondent testified and presented the following
additional witnesses: Charles Stuart, Sandra Haéner, Helen
Grabouski and Linda Cipoletta. His five exhibits were received
without objection. In addition, expert testimony of Leslie L.
Chisholm, Jr., M.D. was presented by deposition filed on August

14, 1991.

The parties’ Epoposed recommended_orders were filed on
August 26, 1991 and September 11, 1991. They have been
considered, and the proposed findings of fact are specifically

addressed in the attached appendix.
4» VFINDINGS OF FACT
1. Mitchell L. Levin, M.D., the Respondent, is, and

. has been at all relevant times, a physician licensed in Florida

 

with license Aer ME 0049603. He practices as a board-

certified opthalmologist with a principal office in Kissimmee,

Florida.

2. The prehearing stipulation filed by the parties at

hearing establishes the following:

a. From on or about May 18, 1989 until on or
about May 22, 1989, Respondent treated
patient #1 for pain in both her eyes and
blurred vision.

b. Respondent's initial examination 0! the
patient on May 18, 1989.:evea1ed.that the
patient had anatomical narrow angles in both
of her eyes.

c. Respondent administered Hydriacyl 1% to
both of the patient's eyes to dilate them for
examination.

d. At the time of Respondent's examination
the patient’s intraocular pressure was 22, 23
in the right eye and 17, 18 in the left eye.

2. The patient developed acute glaucoma‘due
to the administration of hydtiacyl, on May
18, 1989.

1. At approximately 4:45 p.:_ on May 18,’
1989 the patient contacted Respondent’s
office and spoke with a member of
Respondent’s staff.

g. At approximately 7:30 p.m. on May 18,
1989 the patient contacted Respondent's
answering service. At approximately 8:00
p.m. Respondent responded.and spoke with the
patient.

h. At approximately 7:20 a.n. on May 19,
1989 the patient contacted Respondent's
answering service and was advised that .
Respondent’s associate would examine the
patient at 9:00 a.m.

i. Respondent’s associate, Konrad W.
Filutéwski, M.D.,.examined the patient on May
19, 1989 and diagnosed the patient as
suffering from acute glaucoma requiring
suggery.

 

j. At the time of Dr. Filutowski’s

examination of the patient, the patient

related to Dr. Filutowski that she had .

suffered from pain and blurred Vision Slnce

3:00 p.m. the prior day.

k. On May 19, 1989, the patient underwent
bilateral surgical iredectonies to relieve
pressure caused by the acute glaucoma.

3. The administration of Hydriacyl tor dilation in
this case is not a deviation from the standard of care.

HoweVe;, the patient’s narrow angles and slightfy
elevated pressures alerted the physician that dilation could
precipitate acute glaucoma.

Dr. Levin was sufficiently concerned about the
patient’s potential for glaucoma that he had his technician set
up a glaucoma movie for the patient to watch after the
administrationvot the drops and while the eyes were dilating
before his examination.

4. The patient remembers a movie but none of its
details, as her eyes were mostly closed tron the effect or the
drops.

5. Dr. Levin has a packet of information on glaucoma

that he has written and that he routinely hands out to patients.

 

No one specifically remembers giving one of these to Patient :1,

and she denies receiving one.
6. When the patient fiist lett Dr. Levin’s ottice on
May 18, 1989, her eyes were starting to water and she observed
-

that light was very bright. This is not unusual when eyes are

dilated for egemination.

 

Later 1n the afternoon when she was home she felt the

watering increase, felt pressure and then could not see at all
out or her right eye.

She called Dr. Levin’s ottice to let them know in case
something was wrong. The receptihnist reterred her to someone
whom she believed was the doctor's technician and who told the
patient she could expect some discomtort for up to two days.

'7. By approximately 7:00 p.m. the pressure wes.yorse,
and the patient could not see out or either eye. She had her
daughter call the doctor's answering service to explain that
something was terribly wrong.

8. Dr. Levin returned the call within a halt hour.
The patient gave her name and told him she had called his ottice
earlier but that the watering was worse and that she could not

see out 01 either eye.

I He tried to figure out who she was and then told her
the same thing she had heard earlier, that tho discomtort cculd
last up to two days. When she apologized tor calling again, he
told her it was all right to call.

9. As the evening wore on, the pressure became worse.
'The patient kept thinking that it was something she had to

eenduge since the‘aocfor said it night last to: two days. She

 

kept applying a wet washcloth and could not sleep.

In the early morning she tried calling her daughter,

was unsuccessful, and attempted to walk across the street to he:
.s

daughter's house. Her daughter found her disctiented and going

the wrong way.
a

 

Shortly after 7:00 a.n. they called Dr. Levin’s ottice

again and were referred to his associate, Dr. Filutowski tor a
9:00 a.m. appointment.

10. At Dr. Filutowski’s office the patient was
manseous and vomited with the pain;

11. An acute glaucoma attack is accompanied by
rapidly progressive symptoms: blurry vision, then 1055 of
vision, discomfort from pressure, then increasing pain to the
point or nausea and vomiting. -

There is no question that the patient was in extreme
pain in the afternoon or May 18th and throughout the night. she
communicated that pain to Dr. Levin’s ottiee staff and to him
through terms such as “pressure", "watering", "discomfort", and
"blindness".

12.' Under the circumstances described above, when a

patient reports that she is calling for the second time and that

her condition has worsened, a reasonabiy prudent physician

should make a specific inquiry with regard to the symptoms and
degree of pain and should make azrangements to see or have the
patient seen ihmediately.

13. 'Dr. Levin has an office ptetocol which requires
his staff to ask ce;tain questions :5 detethine a patient’s
condition when the patient calls in. Dr. Levin also has an
algorithm, or pathway or questions, ﬁhich he uses to determine a
patient’s needs.-4He believes that he followed that routine with
this patient but that her answers did not alert'him to a

glaucoma attaak.

   

 

He t.< the May 18th evening cap at hon. and did not
have any patients' records with bib. He has no recollection of
the conversation with this patient. He secs from 15 to 70
patients a day in his office and speaks with as many as 40 or 50
a week on the telephone.

14. Both the patient and her daughter remember the
telephone conversation with Dr. Levin thn cvcninq of May 18,
1969. The daughter called and spoke with tho ansuaring sefvice.
When Dr. Levin returned the call the patient spoke directly to
him while her daughter was present.

While she may not have used the torn, "pain", she
conveyed her pressure, extreme dfecomtort, worlcninq condition
and blindness. Dr. Levin did not inquiro into lpccifics and did
not make arrangements for the patient to b. cxaninod. Those
omissions constitute failure to practice uodlcinc with that
level of pare, skill and treatment which is recognized by a
reasonably prudent similar physician as being acceptable under
similar circumstances.

15. Respondent’s disciplinary history includes a
stipulated disposition of a prior_A§ministrativc Cpmplaint,
adopted by final order on April 6, 1990 and relating to
violations other thah Section 458.3311;11;1+ 3*3r
