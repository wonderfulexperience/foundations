FINAL ORDER

THIS CAUSE came before the Board of Medicine (Board) in
Tallahassee, Florida, on August 8, 1992, for the purpose of
considering Respondent’s offer to voluntarily relinquish his
license to practice medicine in the State of Florida. (attached
hereto as Exhibit A.) Said written offer of relinquishment
contains a waiver of probable cause; however, probable cause had
already been found and an Administrative Complaint had been filed;
thus, the purported waiver is of no force and effect. Said written
offer of relinquishment specifically provides: "Respondent may
reapply for licensure as a physician in the State of Florida in the
event his criminal conviction in Case #89-6124-CR-ZLOCH is
subsequently overturned."

Upon consideration of the written offer of voluntary
relinquishment, the charges, and the other documents of record, and
being otherwise fully advised in the premises,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,

That Respondent's Voluntary Relinquishment of his license to

practice medicine in the State of Florida is hereby ACCEPTED.

event his criminal conviction in Case f89-6124-CR-ZLOCH is

taken by the Board of Medicine are reported to the Federation of

In this regard, Respondent waives a finding of probable cause

costs resulting from prosecution or defense of this matter.

this cause. In this regard, Respondent authorizes the Board to
review and examine all investigative file materials concerning
Respondent prior to or in conjunction with consideration of the
Relinquishment. Furthermore, should this Relinquishment not be
accepted by the Board, it is agreed that presentation to and
consideration of this Relinquishment and other documents and
matters by the Board shall not unfairly or illegally prejudice this
Board of any of its members from further participation,
consideration or resolution bf these proceedings.
