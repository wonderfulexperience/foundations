to take disciplinary action against the license of physicians in

that State.

4. On or about March 18, 1987 the "Board“ issued an Order
to Show Gauge alleging that the Respondent procured his license
to practice medicine in Massachusetts by fraud in that Respondent
falsely answered a question on his application for licensure
denying that he had ever been arrested and that Respondent
obtained his Massachusetts medical license by error of the
"Board" in that Respondent, a foreign educated physician, did not
have a medical education substantially equivalent to that of
graduates of medical schools in the United States.

5. Respondent was arrested in Dallas County, Texas on or

about November 17, 1981 for alleged violation of a section of the
Texas Penal Code which provides that a person commits an offense
if he knowingly offers to engage, agrees to engage, or engages in
sexual conduct for a fee.

6. Respondent had not attended medical school for the
length of time set by law for licensure to practice medicine in
Massachusetts therefore, the Board found it unnecessary to reach
the legal issue of whether Respondent obtained a medical
education substantially equivalent to that provided by a 0.5.

State of Maséachusetts issued an order revoking the Respondent's

Section 458.331(1)(b), Florida Statutes, in that he is guilty of

having a license to practice medicine revoked, suspended, or

the licensing authority of any state, territory, or country. The
licensing aﬁthority‘s acceptance of a physician's relinquishment
of a license, stipulation, consent order, or other settlement,
offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of
administrative charges against the physician’s license, shall be
construed as action against the physician's license.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the Board of
Medicine enter an Order imposing one or more of the following
penalties: revocation or suspension of the Respondent's license,
restriction of the Respondent's practice, imposition of an
administrative fine, issuance of a reprimand, placement of the

Respondent on probation, and/or any other relief that the Board
