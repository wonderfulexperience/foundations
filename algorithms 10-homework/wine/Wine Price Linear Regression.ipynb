    "# Regression: Using wine descriptions to predict wine prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a new tool to our toolbox: **regression**. Basically speaking, it predicts numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** predicts **continuous** variables, like \\$7 or \\$7.50 or \\$9.35. **Normal number stuff.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we've predicted using **classification**, which predicts **categorical** variables, like red vs. white.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might get confused that when we did classification our categories were numbers - red might be `2` and white might be `1` and dessert wine might be `0`. But!! The reason regression is different is that you'll **never** have the computer say \"oh it's like 1.5, a little more than white and a little less than red.\" With classification, a prediction is always just one specific category.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short, **if you're trying to predict a number, you want regression.** Let's see how it works!"

    "\n",
    "1. **vocabulary**: are you looking for a specific set of words? It's just a normal list. If you don't give a vocabulary, the computer will figure out the list of words for you (it's pretty good at that!) - so you don't usually use a vocabulary unless you have a REALLY GOOD REASON.\n",
    "1. **ngram_range**: are you only vectorizing single words, or are you also looking at multi-word phrases? By default it only looks for one word `(1,1)`, but you can look for 1-2 word phrases `(1,2)`, only 4-word phrases `(4,4)`, etc.\n",
    "1. **binary**: Do you want to just test to see if a word is included or not, and don't care about counting? `True` or `False`.\n",
    "1. **tokenizer**: are you going to do any stemming or lemmatization, or are you okay with the existing words?\n",
    "1. **stop_words**: do you use stopwords? Stopwords are useless for judging content, but good for judging style. `english` will give default words, or use a list to use multiple.\n",
    "1. **max_features**: if your classifier or regression is too slow, you might want to limit the number of features that the model will use. By default it uses unlimited features, but you can say hey no, use `500` or something like that.\n",
    "1. **max_df**: do you want to not include words that show up in a lot of documents? `0.0`-`1.0` to have a percentage as a ceiling, or an integer to have a maximum number of documents. For example, \"5\" means \"Ignore anything that shows up in more than 5 documents\" \n",
    "1. **min_df**: do you want to not include words that show up in a only a few documents? `0.0`-`1.0` to have a percentage as a floor, or an integer to have a maximum number of documents. For example, \"0.05\" means \"Ignore anything that shows up in fewer than 5% of documents\" \n",
    "1. **use_idf**: do you want to use inverse document frequency, which makes less frequent words more important? (`TfidfVectorizer` only)"
